# Welcome to Dire's Building Gadgets!

`Dire's Building Gadgets` aims to make building a little bit easier. At this time there are `four` tools, and they are described below. Alternatively, watch the following mod spotlight for instructions!

## Important notice

As of Minecraft `1.20.1` this version of Building Gadget (Building Gadgets 1) is officially the 'Legacy' version of Building Gadgets. I will continue to update the mod for the Minecraft versions we already support but this mod will not be ported to Minecraft `1.20.1` or higher.

### What's next?

I'm glad you've asked! Go and download [`Building Gadgets 2`](https://github.com/direwolf20-mc/buildinggadgets2)! It's the same mod but with a bunch of new and awesome features built on a brand-new codebase. It's just better! 

### Why is it better?

We've been officially supporting Building Gadgets 1 since Minecraft `1.12`... That's... *(checks notes)* 6 years! 6 years of updates, bug fixes, feature requests and Minecraft updates. After such a long time, code can become overcomplicated, messy and hard to maintain. When this happens, it's best to start again. After some consideration, we opted to start a new Github Repo and start from a truly clean state.

### Thanks to our contributors

One final note, I would like to thank of all of our contributors to Building Gadgets 1. You've all helped the mod stay updated, feature rich and ever-growing. This mod is vastly different to how it was back in `1.12` and our contributors are to thank for that!

## Usage

To see how to use Dire's `Building Gadgets` refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki) which has been recently updated to be inline with the mod as of `1.16.5`. Please feel free to make feature requests to add more info to our wiki. We're always trying to improve.
