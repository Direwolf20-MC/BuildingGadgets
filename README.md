## Important notice

As of Minecraft `1.20.1` this version of Building Gadget (Building Gadgets 1) is officially the 'Legacy' version of Building Gadgets. I will continue to update the mod for the Minecraft versions we already support but this mod will not be ported to Minecraft `1.20.1` or higher. 

Go and download [`Building Gadgets 2`](https://github.com/direwolf20-mc/buildinggadgets2)! It's the same mod but with a bunch of new and awesome features built on a brand-new codebase.
