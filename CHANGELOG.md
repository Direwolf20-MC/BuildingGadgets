# Changelog

## Fixed

- Fixed the way the stairs mode actually works
  - When looking at a block one below your feet and looking at one of the side faces of the block will allow you to build downwards facing out from that block position.
  - When looking down at the ground and whilst being higher than the location you're looking at. Stairs will now try and build upwards towards you.
  - The rest of the functionality is the same.
