/**
 * An {@link IEnergyStorage} which delegates through to another implementation, but only ever performs simulate actions on the backing storage.
 * To provide similar behaviour to regular extractions/insertions to the backing implementation this uses an accumulated buffer and always simulates
 * insertion/extraction of the accumulated buffer.
 * <p>
 * Notice that reported behaviour will be different from the behaviour of the underlying storage (if no extractions are performed), if and only if there
 * are insert/extract limits on the backing storage. In that case this implementation will only work as long as the accumulated buffer is smaller then
 * the defined limits.
