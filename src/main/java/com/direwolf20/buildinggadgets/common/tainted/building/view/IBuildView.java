/**
 * A "snapshot" view of a specific buildable TemplateItem providing the ability to iterate over the represented {@link PlacementTarget}'s.
 * It also allows for translating to a specific position via {@link #translateTo(BlockPos)}.<br>
 * Furthermore an {@code IBuildView} should provide a hint for users to check the amount of blocks an {@link IBuildView} of this {@code TemplateItem} is going to
 * produce at most via {@link #estimateSize()} in combination with hinting the amount of {@link IUniqueObject}'s required.
 * However this is not strictly necessary and when computation might be costly it is not advised to return an accurate value.
 * <p>
 * The {@code IBuildView} is constructed given an instance of {@link BuildContext}. This
 * context allows the {@link IBuildView} to adapt itself to the environment in which it is viewed. Therefore no assumptions may be made, that
 * 2 distinct instances of {@code IBuildView} will produce the same results even if they were constructed by the same {@link BuildContext}.
 * <p>
 * All Methods in this class may throw an {@link IllegalStateException} if called after the {@code IBuildView} has been closed.
 * @implSpec Notice that no guarantees are made for the order in which {@link PlacementTarget}'s are produced by this {@code IBuildView}.
 * Order may be arbitrary or sorted, consult the documentation of the implementation you are currently faced with for information about traversal order.
